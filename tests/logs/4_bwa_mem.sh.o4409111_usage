-- WARNINGS ----------------------------------------------------------

** Low Walltime utilisation.  While this may be normal, it may help to check the
** following:
**   Did the job parameters specify more walltime than necessary? Requesting
**   lower walltime could help your job to start sooner.
**   Did your analysis complete as expected or did it crash before completing?
**   Did the application run more quickly than it should have? Is this analysis
**   the one you intended to run?
** 
** Excessive Memory utilisation on hpc001. While this may be normal, it may help to
** check the following:
**   Did the job parameters specify enough memory?
**   Did your analysis complete successfully, or did it run out of RAM?
**   Did you use MPI and was the work distributed correctly? Correcting this
**   could allow your job to run using less RAM in each chunk.
**   Did the application use more memory than it should have? Is this analysis
**   the one you intended to run?
